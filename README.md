### 1. Problem Identification

#### 1.1. Problem Statement

Most visits to the emergency department (ED) conclude with the patient being discharged, yet these departments stand out as the primary gateway for hospital admissions. When patients arrive at the ED, they undergo a critical sorting process known as "triage," which determines the urgency of their medical needs. This essential task is usually carried out by a skilled member of the nursing staff who assesses various factors, including the patient's demographic information, their principal complaint, and vital signs. After this initial evaluation, the patient is seen by a medical provider who formulates an initial care plan tailored to their specific situation. Based on this assessment, the provider ultimately makes a recommendation regarding the patientâ€™s next steps, which in this study focuses on whether the patient should be admitted to the hospital or discharged to continue their recovery elsewhere.

The main goal for this project is to predict hospital admissions at the time of ED triage by using patient demographics and information gathered during triage.
